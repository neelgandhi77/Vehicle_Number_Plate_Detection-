# Vehicle_Number_Plate_Detection-
We are having a photo the vehicle with the number plate who have not followed the rules, we have to Segment the number plate from that image (using easyocr).
After segmentation of number plate from image we have to get vehicle numbers from it. 
Simply we have to generate E-challan for that vehicle number and make entry in our database or make CSV File of that Vehicles Numbers with their Offence Details. 
We can also capture Frames from video Footage or Live Video Stream of Roads apply same process.
